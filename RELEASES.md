# Releases

User-facing release notes for dotcl. Each section corresponds to a tagged
release on the public mirror (dotcl/dotcl).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-04-29

Initial public release.

### Highlights

- Common Lisp implementation on .NET 10. Lisp source is compiled to CIL
  and runs on the .NET JIT — same Lisp image runs on Windows, macOS, and
  Linux across x86-64 and ARM64.
- Broadly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard (verified against
  the [ansi-test suite](https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/ansi-test/ansi-test)).
- `dotnet:` package for .NET interop: instantiate types, invoke methods,
  subclass via `dotnet:define-class` (real .NET classes emitted from
  Lisp; frameworks like MAUI / ASP.NET Core / MonoGame see them as
  ordinary subclasses).
- ASDF support (forked + adapted, ships as IL-only `.fasl` for
  cross-platform load).
- Working sample integrations in `samples/`: ASP.NET Core, MAUI,
  MonoGame, MCP server.

### Known limitations

- Single-image model (load-time codegen). No separate compilation per
  file in the traditional Lisp sense.
- Multi-platform R2R AOT currently only available for `win-arm64`.
